#### Demonstration

* This website categorizes books, movies, and music by topic/subject to show related media and correlations between popular media and popular topics. For example, topics will have a number of media links to show how prominent a topic/subject is in media. It can be used for market research when creating a song/movie/book to see if a topic has been covered in a medium, or to see if a topic is currently trending.

## Self Critique

###### What did we do well?

* We did a good job choosing a topic early, and we were good about meeting often and coordinating. We believe the website was very user friendly and well-designed.

<br>

###### What did we learn?

* We learned how to use a lot of new tools we weren't familiar with before 
* We also believe this project was a valuable experience for us to have

---
###### What can we do better?

* Could have done a better job planning out what time we want to meet by making plans earlier, instead of on the day of so we could prepare more.
* Sometimes we should probably have started earlier, because we felt very rushed near the deadline.

<br>

###### What puzzles us?

* We were puzzled by how much media falls under so few topics; there were a lot more connections that we would've guessed when we first started

## Other Critique

###### What did they do well?

* Good idea for a site
* Good UI - easy to navigate
* For their cities page, we like that they have a map for each city
* As customers, we felt that our feedback was always welcome and appreciated.

<br>

---
###### What did we learn?

* Learned about the possible flights to various destinations
* Took a look at these destinations in real time to see what's going on there. 
* They helped us implement filtering (using react-select) and how they were able to change the grid pages based on that filtering by using child-relationships between JS classes and passing functions through props.

---
###### What they could do better

* We really like theiri website, hard to come up with things to improve
* Website is not super beautiful but we understand that's more a difference in preference for design.

<br>

###### What puzzles us about their website

* As said before, there is not much that puzzles us
* We wonder why locations with no incoming or outgoing flights are included in the website
