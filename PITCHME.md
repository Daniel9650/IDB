#### Demonstration

* This website categorizes books, movies, and music by topic/subject to show related media and correlations between popular media and popular topics. For example, topics will have a number of media links to show how prominent a topic/subject is in media. It can be used for market research when creating a song/movie/book to see if a topic has been covered in a medium, or to see if a topic is currently trending.

## Self Critique

---

###### What did we do well?

* We did a good job choosing a topic early, and we were good about meeting often and coordinating. We believe the website was very user friendly and well-designed.

###### What did we learn?

* We learned how to use a lot of new tools we weren't familiar with before, such as React, Docker, and MySQL, just to name a few. We also believe this project was a valuable experience for us to have so we are better prepared to work effectively in other large scale software projects in the future.

###### What can we do better?

* We reflected on some of the things we could do better and thought we could probably have done a better job planning out what time we want to meet by making plans earlier, instead of on the day of. This way we could be a bit more prepared before we meet up together. 
* A few times, we also felt that we should probably have started earlier, because we felt very rushed near the deadline. This could have also given us even more time to learn how to use new tools and if we needed help, we would have had time to ask the TAs or other groups how they solved the issues we'd been stuck on.

###### What puzzles us?

* What puzzled us the most through the course of compling this data and building out site is how so much media falls under so few topics. Before starting this project, we never thought there would be so many relations between these models, but working on this website has given us insight and clarity about how many meaningful connections there are between these types of media.

## Other Critique

###### What did they do well?

* Good idea for a site
* Good UI - easy to navigate
* For their cities page, we like that they have a map for each city
* 404 message has a photo of a papaya, which is nice. 
* As customers, we felt that our feedback was always welcome and appreciated.

###### What did we learn?

* Learned about the possible flights to various destinations
* Took a look at these destinations in real time to see what's going on there. 
* They helped us implement filtering (using react-select) and how they were able to change the grid pages based on that filtering by using child-relationships between JS classes and passing functions through props.

---

###### What they could do better

* We really like theiri website, hard to come up with things to improve
* Website is not super beautiful but we understand that's more a difference in preference for design.

###### What puzzles us about their website

* As said before, there is not much that puzzles us
* We wonder why locations with no incoming or outgoing flights are included in the website
