**Motivation and Uses:**

For our project, we decided to make a website that categorizes books, movies, and music by topic/subject to show related media and correlations between popular media and popular topics. The media makes up a large part of people's lives now and provides a source of entertainment for many of us, no matter how old we are, so we thought it would be interesting to have a way for people to find new books, music, and movies that are currently popular.

It can be used for market research when creating a song/movie/book to see if a topic has been covered in a medium, or to see if a topic is trendy. Users can find different kinds of media based on topics they are interested in. Topics have a number of media links to show how prominent a topic/subject is in media, and possibly in society. For example, a user who is interested in food can look under the topic of food on our Topics page and find different books, songs, and movies about food. The user can then be inspired to look into one of these types of media and find something that would interest them.
