**Other Critique:**

The other team did a good job of coming up with a cool idea for their website. Their website is user friendly and easy to navigate around. The carousel on the home page displayed different photos, one for each of their models, so it was easy to see what models they were using for their project. Their website also had some colors, which made it more appealing to users instead of just using black and white on every page of the website.

From their website, we learned about the possible flights to various cities, and we could take a look at that city during real time. This is helpful when we are planning a trip, and want to know what our destination is like, or if we already bought tickets for a flight and want to know what the current condition is like in the city we're going to. Their website has links to webcams so we can see video footage of our destination before the flight, which is useful so we can prepare for when we land.

For the Flights page, they can consider adding the arrival and departure time for each flight, so users who have a certain preference for flight time can focus on those flights that fit their schedule. They can also add the destination for each flight. For the Cities page, they can maybe remove the "State" part for each city, because that makes it seem like these cities are only in the United States. Many international cities don't have a state that they are part of, just a country, so the state part of each city on their website can be a little confusing. On the carousel, they can also change the font color so the text is visible in front of each image in the background.

They should clarify what the "Category" part for each instance on the Webcams page is supposed to mean. We're also curious as to where they got the webcams for each city, and what they do if there is no webcam for a certain city. Currently, it also doesn't seem like there's a way to connect the cities to the flights and the webcams. For example, if I wanted to see all flights going to New York City, I should be able to view all of those flights from the flights page, but right now, it doesn't seem like there's a way to do this. Lastly, there were some notable issues with their GUI during the presentation, which caused the graphics to flicker wildly and reveal strange error codes for a few moments when clicking around, which they will hopefully be able to resolve soon.
