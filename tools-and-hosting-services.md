**Tools**

We used Postman to make API calls to scrape data from other websites so we could fill out our own website. We also used Postman to document our own API. We made a new API documentation on Postman and added all the different requests a user can make using our API. After planning out the requests for our API on Postman, we then used our Postman API Documentation to write the API Documentation on GitBook. We used Bootstrap as the CSS framework. We also used Python and Flask to implement the Web framework, and our website is hosted using AWS.

**Hosting**

We hosted our site using Amazon Web Services \(AWS\), on an Ubuntu server we created with an elastic IP address. We issue commands to this server via SSH, and built a virtual environment that runs Docker. Using Docker, we are able to run our applications using Flask as our web framework.
